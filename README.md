## About

Authentication is performed using GitHub OAuth 2.0. Users are required to provide a [fine-grained personal access token](https://github.blog/2022-10-18-introducing-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens-for-github/), which will be utilized to send requests to the GitHub API and count repositories. The image badges' links can be regenerated, and they can also be enabled or disabled.

Check out [my profile](https://github.com/infamous55) to see how the images look like.

The project was built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

## To Do

- [ ] Add support for caching
- [ ] Add a language count image badge
